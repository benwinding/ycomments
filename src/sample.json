Now when I want to know what my friends are up to, I go check out their pages, essentially going from a push feed to a pull. It gets me out of the empty crack addiction-esque cycle of going to the news feed and being disappointed&#x2F;bored with the lives of my friends, and instead lets me focus on what facebook is actually valuable for: party planning.</p>",

What happened in the old days was that your social life was much more localized : your street, your neighborhood, your village, your parish, etc. So rather that looking at pictures, you would be on your porch and you would be looking at your friend&#x27;s kids playing in the street , wondering how all these years had gone so fast. Social platform allow to extend your social network beyond some (arbitrary) geographical limitations, but it does not really add anything to the human experience that was not there before, so to speak. I know that I am stating the obvious, but I think &quot;some of these things did not exit before&quot; was a bit too strong.</p>",

The only thing that seemingly &quot;works&quot; has been buying likes by advertising. This video should help educate my clients of the utter uselessness of those too.</p><p>This brings up the interesting question of the general (non)value of a lot of mobile advertising. High impressions, super-low click rates, with many &quot;falsies&quot; because of tricks by the developer, eg where the advert is shown at random, quickly covering up parts of the user interface or extremely close to legitimate user interface elements.</p><p>Case in point, the app &quot;Reddit in Pictures&quot; bounces its adverts up and down at the bottom of the screen. If the advert were static, you wouldn&#x27;t make the mistake of clicking on them, however, due to the bounce it has happened to me at least 20 times in the past month.</p><p>In short: for me the only valuable advert is a google advert... visible at the time when people have actually expressed interest in a topic&#x2F;product, because they search for it. Note: google display network advertising is equally useless&#x2F;fraudulent.</p>",

I posted this over on reddit too but it&#x27;s still pending approval.</p><p>In the case of this ad — I think we actually delivered on what was asked for. The targeting specs were fairly broad (cat lovers in four countries). Getting 39 people who like cats to like a page with a cute cat picture in 20 minutes sounds pretty reasonable to me. If you want a specific kind of cat lover, you’d probably want to target even more specifically (like people in a zip code near you).</p><p>We&#x27;re continually working on making it easier for advertisers to target the right people. Earlier this year I worked on a piece of UI called &quot;Audience Definition&quot; (in our ad create flow), which helps give advertisers guidance on how to target ads more specifically. If you set your advertising too broadly (or too narrowly) -- you get a warning.</p><p>Fake (and low quality) likes are bad for everyone. We don’t want advertisers to get fans that aren’t good for their business -- we want to help them drive real results, and we can’t do that with bad likes. We invest a lot in improving the systems to monitor and remove fake likes from the system, and also in helping advertisers set smart targeting to help them reach the people they care most about.</p><p>And to be honest, a lot of people like cats, and the picture on the page is pretty adorable. Lots of real people like lots of things. And LOTS of people like cats. :P\\n-Peter</p>",

But it is in large part due to the casual way most users navigate the website; which is not going to change. Fake accounts or not you will get a large amount of users that have no relation to your product &#x27;liking&#x27; it. \\nThis is not necessarily bad. I am not sure if this still applies to USA because of the people that have been leaving Facebook lately. But in my country (Mexico), Facebook is used to give &#x27;presence&#x27;. We don&#x27;t expect any actual ROI or new customers directly from Facebook campaigns, but a user looking at a high number of likes does make a difference in trust perception.</p><p>That said, this problem is not present in Google because of the way they present the ads and the way users are navigating when they find them. I believe for this reason Google will always have a great advantage over Facebook and although we won&#x27;t stop spending a small amount of money to keep a higher amount of likes in Facebook it won&#x27;t be near as much as we do for Google.</p><p>For the same reason, that Facebook&#x27;s reaction to ads is based in the way users navigate the website, I don&#x27;t think Facebook will never get a ROI similar to Google.</p>",

This set of priorities isn&#x27;t necessarily something you&#x27;ll realize immediately out of school; I was happy for a while with the technical challenge of the work I was doing in ads, but after a while I realized that my personal preference prioritized the actual product I was shipping higher than I thought, so I switched to something I was more excited about.</p><p>Don&#x27;t listen to anyone stupid enough to tell you that there&#x27;s any universal rule about jobs in ads being crappy (much less a &quot;dead end&quot;; I couldn&#x27;t be happier where I am at this point and spending a couple of years working in the area of ads didn&#x27;t hurt me at all).

This leads to heavy reliance on highly attributable channels like AdWords since you can target people who have expressed high purchase intent. What most companies don&#x27;t do is look closely at multi-channel attribution models and look at how multiple exposures across different media types change purchase behavior. Perhaps someone who is exposed to two display ad driven messages prior to seeing your Google ad is 2x more likely to click and 4x more likely to purchase vs. just being exposed to your Google ad alone. I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s what you will see, but you should be curious to understand those effects.</p><p>We tend to generalize based on our own experiences. I also don&#x27;t think Facebook ads work well in many cases but I also can see brands that are doing a great job or run innovative campaigns that get their message across effectively so I know Facebook works if you get it right. Similarly, many folks give banner ads, mobile CPA ad networks, or TV a shot and see poor outcomes without knowing whether it was poor creative, bad media planning, loose targeting parameters that contributed to the poor outcomes.</p>",

Buying ads on google&#x27;s search engine makes a lot of sense (for us), as google closes the loop from impression to click to sale (ads served to places where sales occur, keyword bids adjusted automatically based on sales).

The reason Yahoo didn&#x27;t care about a technique that extracted the full value of traffic was that advertisers were already overpaying for it. If they merely extracted the actual value, they&#x27;d have made less.</p><p>Hard as it is to believe now, the big money then was in banner ads. Advertisers were willing to pay ridiculous amounts for banner ads. So Yahoo&#x27;s sales force had evolved to exploit this source of revenue. Led by a large and terrifyingly formidable man called Anil Singh, Yahoo&#x27;s sales guys would fly out to Procter &amp; Gamble and come back with million dollar orders for banner ad impressions.</p><p>The prices seemed cheap compared to print, which was what advertisers, for lack of any other reference, compared them to. But they were expensive compared to what they were worth. So these big, dumb companies were a dangerous source of revenue to depend on. But there was another source even more dangerous: other Internet startups.</p><p><a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/yahoo.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;yahoo.html</a></p>",

I mean, obviously if you&#x27;re trying to work out whether it&#x27;s worth paying for Facebook ads, it&#x27;s worth being aware that a large number of Likes isn&#x27;t necessarily a sign of a successful ad, but you don&#x27;t know the &quot;value&quot; of a Like in advance anyway. If you discover that every 1,000 Likes you get 10 more sales (or whatever), then you can work out whether it&#x27;s worth spending money for an ad that will likely bring in 1,000 Likes, whether 990 of those likes are &quot;genuine&quot; Likes that don&#x27;t turn into sales, or 990 of the Likes are click farm Likes.</p><p>I mean, I&#x27;ve never advertised on Facebook, I don&#x27;t know anything about it, but I would have thought you need to measure the actual effectiveness of your ads; whether click farm fake Likes are contributing to this overall effectiveness or not doesn&#x27;t seem relevant to the end result.</p>",

I don&#x27;t spend my time worrying about Facebook, so I haven&#x27;t looked into their ad technology in any depth. Nonetheless, everything in the above video strikes me as spot on, which would also mean that I was exactly right. Facebook&#x27;s entire valuation appears to be based on little more than false advertising and click farming. As the CEO of a publicly-traded corporation with a supposed market capitalization of $162.61 billion, Mark would still appear to be, as I described here (<a href=\"http://www.aarongreenspan.com/writing/essay.html?id=80\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aarongreenspan.com&#x2F;writing&#x2F;essay.html?id=80</a>), the greatest con of all time.</p><p>I hope that based on these findings Facebook finds itself the target of civil actions filed by multiple Attorneys-General and the DOJ, but I doubt very much that our justice system would render a fair outcome even then.</p>",

If so, perhaps FB will be among the first to implode, as there are many who don&#x27;t find the same abysmal metrics with Google, et. al. as they do on FB.

In fact, they <i>hide</i> important features because they are so unusable for <i>the vast majority of their customers</i>. This is tacitly misleading people into believing that what they see is sufficient for success with their product.</p><p>So, FB itself is telling you there&#x27;s a big problem with their product, and this doesn&#x27;t even consider the fraud issue in the OP.

I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the same for you, but not a day goes by where I don&#x27;t overhear someone talking about Facebook in public.</p><p>About the video, the guy ran a poor campaign for a pointless page. He was expecting advertising to work like a magic button where you click it and you get engagement. The guy had no product and no target market. He advertised nothing to everyone. Of course he&#x27;s going to get poor results.</p><p>About the click farms. Yeah, they do exist. But it&#x27;s not Facebook&#x27;s fault. Just like it&#x27;s not Google&#x27;s fault if people use the internet to send spam. You have to think about the scale that Facebook operates. They&#x27;re the number two website in the world. And the number one social network. Let that settle in for a second. Fraudulent activity is, unfortunately, inevitable when you have a site like that.</p><p>The bottom line: become smarter with your ads. Have an actual product and a real audience. Ironically, I know of a copywriter &#x2F; marketer that made a website for the dog niche. He gets 800,000 engagements a week on it. Every one of his posts gets 500-26,000 likes and tons of comments. The site is basically a news site for dogs. He just does content right. And he knows how to advertise. He doesn&#x27;t spend time making fancy videos like this guy did. He gets things done. He gets results. He partners with dog related products and services and makes a killing entirely from a Facebook page.</p><p>This video is an insult to marketers. It&#x27;s like me trying to insert a floppy disk into a cdrom drive, then complaining that computer makers are all frauds.  \\uFEFF</p>",

    "text": "<p>I think I understand the idea behind the video, but to me it looks like an experiment made by a very inexperienced advertiser. This guy could be a <i>god walking between mere mortals</i> on AdWords, but he surely lacks experience with Facebook advertising. Let me summarize why:</p><p>- <i>wrongly setted advertising</i>: Google AdWords and Facebook Ads work in a completely different way. If you try to do advertising with Facebook the same way you do with AdWords... you are going to fail for sure. I work in a start-up that does Facebook Advertisng (AdEspresso [1] ) and I struggle to make customers understand the equation <i>new instrument</i>=<i>new things to learn</i>. The problem with fake clicks exists and has a lot of reasons, but is marginal and partially avoidable. It worsen if you do everything to avoid really interested people (fake page, wrong targets), I don&#x27;t find it strange that you only get fake clicks (and really expensive ones!).</p><p>- <i>how to evaluate the effectiveness of an advertising campaign</i>: the classic and easiest way to measure ROI is the LCA (Last Click Attribution) and is when you click on the ad → do the conversion, some browsing or less than 30 days in the middle are usually not a problem to keep the connection between those two actions. The classic example is AdWords when you are looking for a new razor. But what happens if I see a cool advertisement on Facebook about a cruise but it&#x27;s not time yet for my holidays? I may like the page, visit it, and keep in mind that  there is this really cool agency that sells fantastic cruises. It will come a time when I can ask for holidays at work, I&#x27;ll remember the agency name and I&#x27;ll google it looking for their website, also I may click on one of their ads because is between the top results. Next I buy the cruise: who gets the goal an who is the real dealer? That&#x27;s why you look for Multi Touch Attribution models (MTA). Brand building and brand awareness are serious stuff.</p><p>[1] <a href=\"http://adespresso.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;adespresso.com</a></p>",

Or else why Feb 15? Whatever you say about google, at least\\nthey strive to be fair and honest. I think being fair and honest is not in facebook&#x27;s DNA.

However, those likes turned into an albatross and engagement went through the floor.</p><p>And the crux of the problem wasn&#x27;t that engagement dropped, it was that for this particular client &quot;Likes&quot; were deemed as more valuable than actual engagement. This belief that a Like is the most important conversion Facebook has to offer is something that repeatedly encountered, and one that drives me a little batty.</p>",
